### Cube

CUBE is a game played on the facing sides of a cube with a side dimension of 2. A location is designated by three numbers — e.g., 1, 2, 1. The object is to travel from 1, 1, 1 to 3, 3, 3 by moving one horizontal or vertical (not diagonal) square at a time without striking one of 5 randomly placed landmines. You are staked to $500; prior to each play of the game you may make a wager whether you will reach your destination. You lose if you hit a mine or try to make an illegal move — i.e., change more than one digit from your previous position.

Cube was created by Jerimac Ratliff of Fort Worth, Texas.
