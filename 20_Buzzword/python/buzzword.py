# Buzzword Generator
#
# From: BASIC Computer Games (1978)
#       Edited by David H. Ahl
#
# "This program is an invaluable aid for preparing speeches and
#  briefings about education technology.  This buzzword generator
#  provides sets of three highly-acceptable words to work into your
#  material.  Your audience will never know that the phrases don't
#  really mean much of anything because they sound so great!  Full
#  instructions for running are given in the program.

# "This version of Buzzword was written by David Ahl."

# Porting Notes
#
#   The original program stored all 39 words in one array, then
#   built the buzzword phrases by randomly sampling from each of the
#   three regions of the array (1-13, 14-26, and 27-39).
#
#   Here, we're storing the words for each section in separate
#   tuples.  That makes it easy to just loop through the sections
#   to stitch the phrase together, and it easily accomodates adding
#   (or removing) elements from any section.  They don't all need to
#   be the same length.
#
#   The author of this program (and founder of Creative Computing
#   magazine) first started working at DEC--Digital Equipment
#   Corporation--as a consultant helping the company market its
#   computers as educational products.  He later was editor of a DEC
#   newsletter named "EDU" that focused on using computers in an
#   educational setting.  No surprise, then, that the buzzwords in
#   this program were targeted towards educators!
#
#
# Ideas for Modifications
#
#   Try adding more/different words.  Better yet, add a third
#   dimnension to our WORDS tuple to add new sets of words that
#   might pertain to different fields.  What would business buzzwords
#   be? Engineering buzzwords?  Art/music buzzwords?  Let the user
#   choose a field and pick the buzzwords accordingly.
