### Hello

This is a sample of one of the great number of conversational programs. In a sense, it is like a CAI program except that its responses are just good fun. Whenever a computer is exhibited at a convention or conference with people that have not used a computer before, the conversational programs seem to get the first activity.

In this particular program, the computer dispenses advice on various problems such as sex. health, money, or job.
