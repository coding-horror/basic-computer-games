### Chemist

The fictitious chemical, kryptocyanic acid, can only be diluted by the ratio of 7 parts water to 3 parts acid. Any other ratio causes an unstable compound which soon explodes. Given an amount of acid, you must determine how much water to add to the dilution. If youâ€™re more than 5% off, you lose one of your nine lives. The program continues to play until you lose all nine lives or until it is interrupted.

It was originally written by Wayne Teeter of Ridgecrest, California.
