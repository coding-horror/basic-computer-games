### Roulette

This game simulates an American Roulette wheel; “American” because it has 38 number compartments (1 to 36, 0 and 00). The European wheel has 37 numbers (1 to 36 and 0). The Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and South American countries are slowly switching to the American wheel because it gives the house a bigger percentage. Odd and even numbers alternate around the wheel, as do red and black. The layout of the wheel insures a highly random number pattern. In fact, roulette wheels are sometimes used to generate tables of random numbers.

In this game, you may bet from $5 to $500 and you may bet on red or black, odd or even, first or second 18 numbers, a column, or single number. You may place any number of bets on each spin of the wheel.

There is no long-range winning strategy for playing roulette. However, a good strategy is that of “doubling.” First spin, bet $1 on an even/odds bet (odd, even, red, or black). If you lose, double your bet again to $2. If you lose again, double to $4. Continue to double until you win (i.e, you break even on a losing sequence). As soon as you win, bet $1 again, and after every win, bet $1. Do not ever bet more than $1 unless you are recuperating losses by doubling. Do not ever bet anything but the even odds bets. Good luck!
