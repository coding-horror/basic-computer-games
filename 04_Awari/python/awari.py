# PORTING NOTES
#
# This game started out as 70 lines of BASIC, and I have ported it
# before. I find it somewhat amazing how efficient (densely packed) the
# original code is. Of course, the original code has fairly cryptic
# variable names (as was forced by BASIC's limitation on long (2+
# character) variable names). I have done my best here to interpret what
# each variable is doing in context, and rename them appropriately.
#
# I have endeavored to leave the logic of the code in place, as it's
# interesting to see a 2-ply game tree evaluation written in BASIC,
# along with what a reader in 2021 would call "machine learning".
#
# As each game is played, the move history is stored as base-6
# digits stored losing_book[game_number]. If the human player wins or
# draws, the computer increments game_number, effectively "recording"
# that loss to be referred to later. As the computer evaluates moves, it
# checks the potential game state against these losing game records, and
# if the potential move matches with the losing game (up to the current
# number of moves), that move is evaluated at a two point penalty.
#
# Compare this, for example with MENACE, a mechanical device for
# "learning" tic-tac-toe:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine
#
# The base-6 representation allows game history to be VERY efficiently
# represented. I considered whether to rewrite this representation to be
# easier to read, but I elected to TRY to document it, instead.
#
# Another place where I have made a difficult decision between accuracy
# and correctness is inside the "wrapping" code where it considers
# "while human_move_end > 13". The original BASIC code reads:
#
# 830 IF L>13 THEN L=L-14:R=1:GOTO 830
#
# I suspect that the intention is not to assign 1 to R, but to increment
# R. I discuss this more in a porting note comment next to the
# translated code. If you wish to play a more accurate version of the
# game as written in the book, you can convert the increment back to an
# assignment.
#
# I continue to be impressed with this jewel of a game; as soon as I had
# the AI playing against me, it was beating me. I've been able to score
# a few wins against the computer, but even at its 2-ply lookahead, it
# beats me nearly always. I would like to become better at this game to
# explore the effectiveness of the "losing book" machine learning.
#
#
# EXERCISES FOR THE READER
# One could go many directions with this game:
# - change the initial number of stones in each pit
# - change the number of pits
# - only allow capturing if you end on your side of the board
# - don't allow capturing at all
# - don't drop a stone into the enemy "home"
# - go clockwise, instead
# - allow the player to choose to go clockwise or counterclockwise
# - instead of a maximum of two moves, allow each move that ends on the
#   "home" to be followed by a free move.
# - increase the AI lookahead
# - make the scoring heuristic a little more nuanced
# - store history to a file on disk (or in the cloud!) to allow the AI
#   to learn over more than a single session
