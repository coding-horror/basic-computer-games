### Amazing

This program will print out a different maze every time it is run and guarantees only one path through. You can choose the dimensions of the maze — i.e. the number of squares wide and long.

The original program author was Jack Hauber of Windsor, Connecticut.

**2022-01-04:** patched original source in [#400](https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games/pull/400) to fix a minor bug where a generated maze may be missing an exit, particularly at small maze sizes.
