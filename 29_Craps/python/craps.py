"""This game simulates the games of craps played according to standard Nevada craps table rules.

That is:

1. A 7 or 11 on the first roll wins
2. A 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll loses
3. Any other number rolled becomes your "point." You continue to roll; if you get your point you win. If you
   roll a 7, you lose and the dice change hands when this happens.

This version of craps was modified by Steve North of Creative Computing. It is based on an original which
appeared one day one a computer at DEC.
