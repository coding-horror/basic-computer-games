### Flip Flop

The object of this game is to change a row of ten X’s

```
X X X X X X X X X X
```

to a row of ten 0’s

```
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

by typing in a number corresponding to the position of an “X” in the line. On some numbers one position will change while on other numbers, two will change. For example, inputting a 3 may reverse the X and 0 in position 3, but it might possibly reverse some of other position too! You ought to be able to change all 10 in 12 or fewer moves. Can you figure out a good winning strategy?

To reset the line to all X’s (same game), type 0 (zero). To start a new game at any point, type 11.

The original author of this game was Micheal Kass of New Hyde Park, New York.
