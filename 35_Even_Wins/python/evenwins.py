# evenwins.py

#
# This version of evenwins.bas based on game decscription and does *not*
# follow the source. The computer chooses marbles at random.
#
# For simplicity, global variables are used to store the game state.
# A good exercise would be to replace this with a class.
#
# The code is not short, but hopefully it is easy for beginners to understand
# and modify.
#
# Infinite loops of the style "while True:" are used to simplify some of the
# code. The "continue" keyword is used in a few places to jump back to the top
# of the loop. The "return" keyword is also used to break out of functions.
# This is generally considered poor style, but in this case it simplifies the
# code and makes it easier to read (at least in my opinion). A good exercise
# would be to remove these infinite loops, and uses of continue, to follow a
# more structured style.
