# Slots
#
# From Basic Computer Games (1978)
#
#    "The slot machine or one-arm bandit is a mechanical
#   device that will absorb coins just about as fast as
#   you can feed it. After inserting a coin, you pull a
#   handle that sets three indepent reels spining. If the
#   reels stop with certain symbols appearing in the pay
#   line, you get a certain payoff. The original slot
#   machine, called the Liberty bell, was invented in 1895
#   by Charles Fey in San Francisco. Fey refused to sell
#   or lease the manufacturing rights, so H.S. Mills in
#   Chicago built a similar, but much improved, machine
#   called the Operators Bell. This has survived nearly
#   unchanged to today.
#     On the operators Bell and other standard slot
#   machines, there are 20 symbols on each wheel but they
#   are not distributed evenly among the objects(cherries,
#   bar, apples, etc). Of the 8000 possible combinations,
#   the expected payoff(to the player) is 7049 or $89.11
#   for every $100.00 put in, one of the lowest expected
#   payoffs of all casino games.
#     In the program here, the payoff is considerably more
#   liberal; indeed it appears to favor the player by 11%
#   -- i.e., an expected payoff of $111 for each $100 bet."
#     The program was originally written by Fred Mirabelle
#   and Bob Harper

#   The selections of the fruits(Bar, apples, lemon, etc.) are made

#   It could be added a weights list to the function and therefore
