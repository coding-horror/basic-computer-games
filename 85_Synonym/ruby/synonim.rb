# Synonym
#
# From Basic Computer Games (1978)
#
# A synonym of a word is another word (in the English language) which has the same,
# or very nearly the same, meaning. This program tests your knowledge of synonyms
# of a few common words.
#
# The computer chooses a word and asks you for a synonym. The computer then tells
# you whether you’re right or wrong. If you can’t think of a synonym, type “HELP”
# which causes a synonym to be printed.
# You may put in words of your choice in the data statements.
# The number following DATA in Statement 500 is the total number of data statements.
# In each data statement, the first number is the number of words in that statement.
#
# Can you think of a way to make this into a more general kind of CAI program for any subject?
# Walt Koetke of Lexington High School, Massachusetts created this program.

A SYNONYM OF A WORD MEANS ANOTHER WORD IN THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE WHICH HAS THE SAME OR VERY NEARLY THE SAME MEANING.

# Porting notes
#
#  There is a bug in the original program where if you keep asking for
# synoyms of a given word it ends up running out of synonyms
# in the array and the program crashes.
#  The bug has been fixed in this version and now when
# it runs out of words it continues with the next
# array.
