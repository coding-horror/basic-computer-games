### Letter

LETTER is similar to the game GUESS in which you guess a number chosen by the computer; in this program, the computer picks a random letter of the alphabet and you must guess which one it is using the clues provided as you go along. It should not take you more than five guesses to get the mystery letter.

The program which appears here is loosely based on the original written by Bob Albrect of People’s Computer Company.
