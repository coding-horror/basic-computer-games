SPLAT

Splat similates a parachute jump in which you try to open your parachute
at the last possible moment without going splat! You may select your own
terminal velocity or let the computer do it for you. You may also select
the acceleration due to gravity or, again, let the computer do it
in which case you might wind up on any one of the eight planets (out to
Neptune), the moon, or the sun.

The computer then tells you the height you're jumping from and asks for
the seconds of free fall. It then divides your free fall time into eight
intervals and gives you progress reports on the way down. The computer
also keeps track of all prior jumps and lets you know how you compared
with previous successful jumps. If you want to recall information from
previous runs, then you should store the array `successful_jumps` on
disk and read it before each run.

John Yegge created this program while at the Oak Ridge Associated
Universities.
