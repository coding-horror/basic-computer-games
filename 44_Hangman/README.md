### Hangman

This is a simulation of the word guessing game, hangman. The computer picks a word, tells you how many letters in the word it has picked and then you guess a letter in the word. If you are right, the computer tells you where that letter belongs; if your letter is wrong, the computer starts to hang you. You get ten guesses before you are completely hanged:
1. Head
2. Body
3. Right Arm
4. Left Arm
5. Right Leg
6. Left Leg
7. Right Hand
8. Left Hand
9. Right Foot
10. Left Foot

You may add words in Data statements; however if you do, you must also change the random word selector.

David Ahl modified this program into its current form from the one created by Kenneth Aupperle of Melville, New York.
