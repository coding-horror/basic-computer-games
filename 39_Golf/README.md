### Golf

This is a single player golf game. In other words it’s you against the golf course (the computer). The program asks for your handicap (maximum of 30) and your area of difficulty. You have a bag of 29 clubs plus a putter. On the course you have to contend with rough, trees, on and off fairway, sand traps, and water hazards. In addition, you can hook, slice, go out of bounds, or hit too far. On putting, you determine the potency factor (or percent of swing). Until you get the swing of the game (no pun intended), you’ll probably was to use a fairly high handicap.

Steve North of Creative Computing modified the original version of this game, the author of which is unknown.
