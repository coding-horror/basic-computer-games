### Target

In this program, you are firing a weapon from a spaceship in 3-dimensional space. Your ship, the Starship Enterprise, is located at the origin (0,0,0) of a set of x,y,z coordinates. You will be told the approximate location of the target in 3-dimensional rectangular coordinates, the approximate angular deviation from the x and z axes in both radians and degrees, and the approximate distance to the target.

Given this information, you then proceed to shoot at the target. A shot within 20 kilometers of the target destroys it. After each shot, you are given information as to the position of the explosion of your shot and a somewhat improved estimate of the location of the target. Fortunately, this is just practice and the target doesn’t shoot back. After you have attained proficiency, you ought to be able to destroy a target in 3 or 4 shots. However, attaining proficiency might take a while!

The author is H. David Crockett of Fort Worth, Texas.
