               Creative Computing  Morristown, New Jersey



You are the weapons officer on the Starship Enterprise
and this is a test to see how accurate a shot you
are in a three-dimensional range.  You will be told
the radian offset for the X and Z axes, the location
of the target in three dimensional rectangular coordinates,
the approximate number of degrees from the X and Z
axes, and the approximate distance to the target.
You will then proceed to shoot at the target until it is
destroyed!

Good luck!!
