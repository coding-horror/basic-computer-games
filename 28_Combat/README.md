### Combat

In this game, you are fighting a small-scale war with the computer. You have 72,000 troops which you first ust distribute among your Army, Navy, and Air Force. You may distribute them in any way you choose as long as you don’t use more than 72,000.

You then attack your opponent (the computer) and input which service and the number of men you wish to use. The computer then tells you the outcome of the battle, gives you the current statistics and allows you to determine your next move.

After the second battle, it is decided from the total statistics whether you win or lose or if a treaty is signed.

This program was created by Bob Dores of Milton, Massachusetts.
