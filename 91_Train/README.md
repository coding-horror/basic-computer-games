### Train

TRAIN is a program which uses the computer to generate problems with random initial conditions to teach about the time-speed-distance relationship (distance = rate x time). You then input your answer and the computer verifies your response.

TRAIN is merely an example of a student-generated problem. Maximum fun (and benefit) comes more from _writing_ programs like this as opposed to solving the specific problem posed. Exchange your program with others—you solve their problem and let them solve yours.

TRAIN was originally written in FOCAL by one student for use by others in his class. It was submitted to us by Walt Koetke, Lexington High School, Lexington, Mass.
