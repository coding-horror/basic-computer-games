Computer picks a 3-digit secret number, using digits 0-9 (no repeating digits allowed).  User then allowed up to twenty guesses towards picking correct number; the computer offers feedback "clues" based on your guesswork.

Feedback:

PICO        One digit is correct, but in the wrong place.

FERMI       One digit is in the correct place.

Bagels      No digit is correct.

User should draw inferences based on feedback to make a correct guess.  A "good" strategy should take no more than eight guesses, they say.
