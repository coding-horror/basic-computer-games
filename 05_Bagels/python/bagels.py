"""
Bagels

From: BASIC Computer Games (1978)
      Edited by David H. Ahl

"In this game, the computer picks a 3-digit secret number using
 the digits 0 to 9 and you attempt to guess what it is.  You are
 allowed up to twenty guesses.  No digit is repeated.  After
 each guess the computer will give you clues about your guess
 as follows:

 PICO     One digit is correct, but in the wrong place
 FERMI    One digit is in the correct place
 BAGELS   No digit is correct

"You will learn to draw inferences from the clues and, with
 practice, you'll learn to improve your score.  There are several
 good strategies for playing Bagels.  After you have found a good
 strategy, see if you can improve it.  Or try a different strategy
 altogether and see if it is any better.  While the program allows
 up to twenty guesses, if you use a good strategy it should not
 take more than eight guesses to get any number.

"The original authors of this program are D. Resek and P. Rowe of
 the Lawrence Hall of Science, Berkeley, California."

#
# Porting Notes
#
#   The original program did an unusually good job of validating the
#   player's input (compared to many of the other programs in the
#   book). Those checks and responses have been exactly reproduced.
#
#
# Ideas for Modifications
#
#   It should probably mention that there's a maximum of MAX_NUM
#   guesses in the instructions somewhere, shouldn't it?
#
#   Could this program be written to use anywhere from, say 2 to 6
#   digits in the number to guess? How would this change the routine
#   that creates the "result" string?
