### Gunner

GUNNER allows you to adjust the fire of a field artillery weapon to hit a stationary target. You specify the number of degrees of elevation of your weapon; 45 degrees provides maximum range with values under or over 45 degrees providing less range.

You get up to five shots to destroy the enemy before he destroys you. Gun range varies between 20,000 and 60,000 yards and burst radius is 100 yards. You must specify elevation within approximately 0.2 degrees to get a hit.

Tom Kloos of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in Portland, Oregon originally wrote GUNNER. Extensive modifications were added by David Ahl.
