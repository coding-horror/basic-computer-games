Conversion to [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org).

NOTE: I have added `wait` statements before and while printing the lightning bolt, without which it appears too quickly to be properly dramatic.

Ways to play:

0. Try-It! Page:
Go to https://miniscript.org/tryit/, clear the sample code from the code editor, and paste in the contents of chief.ms.  Then click the "Run Script" button.  Program output (and input) will appear in the green-on-black terminal display to the right of or below the code editor.

1. Command-Line MiniScript:
Download for your system from https://miniscript.org/cmdline/, install, and then run the program with a command such as:

	miniscript chief.ms

2. Mini Micro:
Download Mini Micro from https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/, launch, and then click the top disk slot and chose "Mount Folder..."  Select the folder containing the BASIC program.  Then, at the Mini Micro command prompt, enter:

	load "chief"
	run
