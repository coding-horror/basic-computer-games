### Change

In this program, the computer pretends it is the cashier at your friendly neighborhood candy store. You tell it the cost of the item(s) you are buying, the amount of your payment, and it will automatically (!) determine your correct change. Aren’t machines wonderful? Dennis Lunder of People’s Computer Company wrote this program.
