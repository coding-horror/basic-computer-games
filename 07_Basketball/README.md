### Basketball

This program simulates a game of basketball between Dartmouth College and an opponent of your choice. You are the Dartmouth captain and control the type of shot and defense during the course of the game.

There are four types of shots:
1. Long Jump Shot (30ft)
2. Short Jump Shot (15ft)
3. Lay Up
4. Set Shot

Both teams use the same defense, but you may call it:
- Enter (6): Press
- Enter (6.5): Man-to-man
- Enter (7): Zone
- Enter (7.5): None

To change defense, type “0” as your next shot.

Note: The game is biased slightly in favor of Dartmouth. The average probability of a Dartmouth shot being good is 62.95% compared to a probability of 61.85% for their opponent. (This makes the sample run slightly remarkable in that Cornell won by a score of 45 to 42 Hooray for the Big Red!)

Charles Bacheller of Dartmouth College was the original author of this game.
