### Mugwump

Your objective in this game is to find the four Mugwumps hiding on various squares of a 10 by 10 grid. Homebase (lower left) is position (0,0) and a guess is a pair of whole numbers (0 to 9), separated by commas. The first number is the number of units to the right of homebase and the second number is the distance above homebase.

You get ten guesses to locate the four Mugwumps; after each guess, the computer tells you how close you are to each Mugwump. Playing the game with the aid of graph paper and a compass should allow you to find all the Mugwumps in six or seven moves using triangulation similar to Loran radio navigation.

If you want to make the game somewhat more difficult, you can print the distance to each Mugwump either rounded or truncated to the nearest integer.

This program was modified slightly by Bob Albrecht of People’s Computer Company. It was originally written by students of Bud Valenti of Project SOLO in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.
