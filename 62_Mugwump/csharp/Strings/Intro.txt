The object of this game is to find four mugwumps
hidden on a 10 by 10 grid.  Homebase is position 0,0.
Any guess you make must be two numbers with each
number between 0 and 9, inclusive.  First number
is distance to right of homebase and second number
is distance above homebase.

You get 10 tries.  After each try, I will tell
you how far you are from each wugwump.
