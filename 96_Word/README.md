### Word

WORD is a combination of HANGMAN and BAGELS. In this game, the player must guess a word with clues as to a letter position furnished by the computer. However, instead of guessing one letter at a time, in WORD you guess an entire word (or group of 5 letters, such as ABCDE). The computer will tell you if any letters that you have guessed are in the mystery word and if any of them are in the correct position. Armed with these clues, you go on guessing until you get the word or, if you can’t get it, input a “?” and the computer will tell you the mystery word.

You may change the words in Data Statements, but they must be 5-letter words.

The author of this program is Charles Reid of Lexington High School, Lexington, Massachusetts.
