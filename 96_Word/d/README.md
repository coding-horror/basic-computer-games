Original source downloaded from [Vintage Basic](http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html)

Converted to [D](https://dlang.org/) by [Bastiaan Veelo](https://github.com/veelo).

The Basic original required words to be exactly five letters in length for the program to behave correctly.
This version does not replicate that limitation, and the test for that requirement is commented out.

## Running the code

Assuming the reference [dmd](https://dlang.org/download.html#dmd) compiler:
```shell
dmd -dip1000 -run word.d
```

[Other compilers](https://dlang.org/download.html) also exist.
