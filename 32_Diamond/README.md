### Diamond

This program fills an 8.5x11 piece of paper with diamonds (plotted on a hard-copy terminal, of course). The program asks for an odd number to be input in the range 5 to 31. The diamonds printed will be this number of characters high and wide. The number of diamonds across the page will vary from 12 for 5-character wide diamonds to 1 for a diamond 31-characters wide. You can change the content of the pattern if you wish.

The program was written by David Ahl of Creative Computing.
