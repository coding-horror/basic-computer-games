        THIS IS THE GAME OF "REVERSE".  TO WIN, ALL YOU HAVE
        TO DO IS ARRANGE A LIST OF NUMBERS (1 THROUGH {})
        IN NUMERICAL ORDER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.  TO MOVE, YOU
        TELL ME HOW MANY NUMBERS (COUNTING FROM THE LEFT) TO
        REVERSE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE CURRENT LIST IS:

        2 3 4 5 1 6 7 8 9

        AND YOU REVERSE 4, THE RESULT WILL BE:

        5 4 3 2 1 6 7 8 9

        NOW IF YOU REVERSE 5, YOU WIN!

        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

        NO DOUBT YOU WILL LIKE THIS GAME, BUT
        IF YOU WANT TO QUIT, REVERSE 0 (ZERO).
