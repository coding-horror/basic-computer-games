### Digits

The player writes down a set of 30 numbers (0, 1, or 2) at random prior to playing the game. The computer program, using pattern recognition techniques, attempts to guess the next number in your list.

The computer asks for 10 numbers at a time. It always guesses first and then examines the next number to see if it guessed correctly. By pure luck (or chance or probability), the computer ought to be right 10 times. It is uncanny how much better it generally does than that!

This program originated at Dartmouth; original author unknown.
