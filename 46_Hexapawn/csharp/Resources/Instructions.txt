This program plays the game of Hexapawn.
Hexapawn is played with Chess pawns on a 3 by 3 board.
The pawns are move as in Chess - one space forward to
an empty space, or one space forward and diagonally to
capture an opposing man.  On the board, your pawns
are 'O', the computer's pawns are 'X', and empty
squares are '.'.  To enter a move, type the number of
the square you are moving from, followed by the number
of the square you will move to.  The numbers must be
separated by a comma.

The computer starts a series of games knowing only when
the game is won (a draw is impossible) and how to move.
It has no strategy at first and just moves randomly.
However, it learns from each game.  Thus winning becomes
more and more difficult.  Also, to help offset your
initial advantage, you will not be told how to win the
game but must learn this by playing.

The numbering of the board is as follows:
          123
          456
          789

For example, to move your rightmost pawn forward,
you would type 9,6 in response to the question
'Your move ?'.  Since I'm a good sport, you'll always
go first.
