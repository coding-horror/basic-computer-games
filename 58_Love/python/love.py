# LOVE

# From: BASIC Computer Games (1978)
#       Edited by David H. Ahl
#
# "This program is designed to reproduce Robert Indiana's great art
#  work 'Love' with a message of your choice up to 60 characters long.
#
# "The [DATA variable is] an alternating count of the number
#  of characters and blanks which form the design.  These data give
#  the correct proportions for a standard 10 character per inch
#  Teletype or line printer.

# Porting Notes
#
#   Not too different from the original, logic-wise. The image was
#   originally encoded as a series of BASIC "DATA" lines. Here,
#   we've converted it to a more Pythonic nested list structure.
#   Other changes include reducing some of the vertical spacing
#   (since we'll probably be showing this on a screen rather than
#   the sort of tractor-feed printer the program was written for)
#   and having the message default to LOVE when no input is given.
#
#   This program uses a simple version of run-length encoding to
#   compress a 60 x 36 image (2,160 characters) into just 252 DATA
#   values.  That's about an 8.5-to-1 data compression ratio,
#   which is pretty good!
#
#
# Ideas for Modifications
#
#   Process the user's message input to remove spaces and change
#   to uppercase.
#
#   Encode other images in a similar fashion and let the user choose
#   which one they'd like to use to display their message.
#
#   To help with the above step, create a program that reads in a
#   text file of any sort of similar character/space art and produces
#   the Python code to initialize the correct nested list of values.
#
#   For example, if the input file were:
#
#     *****
#     *  **
#     **  *
#
#   Your program would output:
#
#    ((5, ), (1, 1, 2), (2, 1, 1))
