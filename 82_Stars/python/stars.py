"""
Stars

From: BASIC Computer Games (1978)
      Edited by David H. Ahl

"In this game, the computer selects a random number from 1 to 100
 (or any value you set [for MAX_NUM]).  You try to guess the number
 and the computer gives you clues to tell you how close you're
 getting.  One star (*) means you're far away from the number; seven
 stars (*******) means you're really close.  You get 7  guesses.

"On the surface this game is very similar to GUESS; however, the
 guessing strategy is quite different.  See if you can come up with
 one or more approaches to finding the mystery number.

"Bob Albrecht of People's Computer Company created this game."

# Porting Notes
#
#   The original program never exited--it just kept playing rounds
#   over and over.  This version asks to continue each time.
#
#
# Ideas for Modifications
#
#   Let the player know how many guesses they have remaining after
#   each incorrect guess.
#
#   Ask the player to select a skill level at the start of the game,
#   which will affect the values of MAX_NUM and MAX_GUESSES.
#   For example:
#
#       Easy   = 8 guesses, 1 to 50
#       Medium = 7 guesses, 1 to 100
#       Hard   = 6 guesses, 1 to 200
