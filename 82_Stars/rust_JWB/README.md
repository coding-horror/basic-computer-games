#STARS

From: BASIC Computer Games (1978), edited by David H. Ahl

In this game, the computer selects a random number from 1 to 100
(or any value you set [for MAX_NUM]).  You try to guess the number
and the computer gives you clues to tell you how close you're
getting.  One star (*) means you're far away from the number; seven
stars (*******) means you're really close.  You get 7  guesses.

On the surface this game is very similar to GUESS; however, the
guessing strategy is quite different.  See if you can come up with
one or more approaches to finding the mystery number.

Bob Albrecht of People's Computer Company created this game.
