In this program, we shall refer to disks by numerical code.
3 will represent the smallest disk, 5 the next size,
7 the next, and so on, up to 15.  If you do the puzzle with
2 disks, their code names would be 13 and 15.  With 3 disks
the code names would be 11, 13 and 15, etc.  The needles
are numbered from left to right, 1 to 3.  We will
startup with the disks on needle 1, and attempt to move them
to needle 3.

Good luck!
