### Kinema

This program tests your fundamental knowledge of kinematics. It presents a simple problem: a ball is thrown straight up into the air at some random velocity. You then must answer three questions about the flight of the ball:
1. How high will it go?
2. How long until it returns to earth?
3. What will be its velocity after a random number of seconds?

The computer evaluates your performance; within 15% of the correct answer is considered close enough. After each run, the computer gives you another problem until you interrupt it.

KINEMA was shorted from the original Huntington Computer Project Program, KINERV, by Richard Pav of Patchogue High School, Patchogue, New York.
