# Acey Ducey
#
# From: BASIC Computer Games (1978)
#       Edited by David Ahl
#
# "This is a simulation of the Acey Ducey card game.
#  In the game, the dealer (the computer) deals two
#  cards face up.  You have an option to bet or not to
#  bet depending on whether or not you feel the next
#  card dealt will have a value between the first two.
#
# "Your initial money is set to $100. The game keeps
#  going on until you lose all your money or interrupt
#  the program.
#
# "The original BASIC program author was Bill Palmby
#  of Prairie View, Illinois."

# Python port by Jeff Jetton, 2019

# Porting notes:
#
#   The original BASIC version had a variable named N
#   that was initialized to 100 and then never used.
#   Maybe it did something in feature that was edited
#   out of the final version used in the book?
#
#   The original program simply generated random numbers
#   for each card.  It did not simulate a true card deck,
#   where the dealing of a card eliminates it from the
#   deck and reduces the chances of the same value
#   being drawn.  This "infinite deck" logic (or "deal,
#   with replacement after") has NOT been changed.
#
#   In the interests of historical fidelity, the bug
#   in the original BASIC listing that let you input a
#   negative bet value has been faithfully reproduced.
#   This lets the player lose money when they win and
#   earn money when they lose! :-)
#
#
# Ideas for Modifications
#
#   Give the user the ability to quit the game, perhaps
#   by typing "quit" instead of making a bet.  Provide a
#   final assessment based on how much of the original
#   bankroll they have left.
#
#   Or have the game run for a set number of rounds or
#   until a certain bankroll goal is attained.
#
#   Implement an "ante"--a set amount the player has to
#   bet each time rather than having the option to lay
#   out entirely.
#
#   See "porting notes" above about negative bet values.
#   How would you fix this?
#
#   When the player "chickens out", show them what the
#   next card would've been and point out whether they
#   made a good or bad decision.
#
#   In what situations are the odds of winning high
#   enough to justify making a bet? Create a cheat mode
#   where the program identifies these situations and
#   lets the player know.
#
#   Change the card dealing to simulate deals from a
#   single deck (or a user-selectable number of decks).
#
#   Implement a two-player mode where players take turns
#   betting (or both bet on the same dealer cards and
#   get their own player card dealt).
