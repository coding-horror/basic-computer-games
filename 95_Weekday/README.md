### Weekday

This program gives facts about your date of birth (or some other day of interest). It is not prepared to give information on people born before the use of the current type of calendar, i.e. year 1582.

You merely enter today’s date in the form—month, day, year and your date of birth in the same form. The computer then tells you the day of the week of your birth date, your age, and how much time you have spent sleeping, eating, working, and relaxing.

This program was adapted from a GE timesharing program by Tom Kloos at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry.
