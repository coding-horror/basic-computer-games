# Dice
#
# From: BASIC Computer Games (1978)
#       Edited by David H. Ahl
#
# "Not exactly a game, this program simulates rolling
#  a pair of dice a large number of times and prints out
#  the frequency distribution.  You simply input the
#  number of rolls.  It is interesting to see how many
#  rolls are necessary to approach the theoretical
#  distribution:
#
#  2  1/36  2.7777...%
#  3  2/36  5.5555...%
#  4  3/36  8.3333...%
#    etc.

# "Daniel Freidus wrote this program while in the
#  seventh grade at Harrison Jr-Sr High School,
#  Harrison, New York."

# Porting Notes
#
#   A fairly straightforward port.  The only change is
#   in the handling of the user's "try again" response.
#   The original program only continued if the user
#   entered "YES", whereas this version will continue
#   if any word starting with "Y" or "y" is given.
#
#   The instruction text--which, like all these ports,
#   was taken verbatim from the original listing--is
#   charmingly quaint in its dire warning against
#   setting the number of rolls too high.  At the time
#   of this writing, on a fairly slow computer, a
#   5000-roll run typically clocks in at well under
#   1/10 of a second!
#
#
# Ideas for Modifications
#
#   Have the results include a third column showing
#   the percent of rolls each count represents.  Or
#   (better yet) print a low-fi bar graph using
#   rows of asterisks to represent relative values,
#   with each asterisk representing one percent,
#   for example.
#
#   Add a column showing the theoretically expected
#   percentage, for comparison.
#
#   Keep track of how much time the series of rolls
#   takes and add that info to the final report.
#
#   What if three (or four, or five...) dice were
#   rolled each time?
