### Dice

Not exactly a game, this program simulates rolling a pair of dice a large number of times and prints out the frequency distribution. You simply input the number of rolls. It is interesting to see how many rolls are necessary to approach the theoretical distribution:

|   |      |            |
|---|------|------------|
| 2 | 1/36 | 2.7777...% |
| 3 | 2/36 | 5.5555...% |
| 4 | 3/36 | 8.3333...% |
etc.

Daniel Freidus wrote this program while in the seventh grade at Harrison Jr-Sr High School, Harrison, New York.
