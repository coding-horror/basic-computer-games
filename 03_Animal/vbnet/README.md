Conversion to [Visual Basic .NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_.NET)

This takes some inspiration from the [C# port of Animal](https://github.com/zspitz/basic-computer-games/tree/main/03_Animal/csharp).

The `Game` class takes a console abstraction (`ConsoleAdapterBase`), which could also be used for different UIs, such as WinForms or a web page.
This solution also has an xUnit tests project.
Responses can be entered in any capitalization, but animals and the distinguishing question will be converted to uppercase.
