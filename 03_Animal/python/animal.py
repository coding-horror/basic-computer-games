Animal

From: Basic computer Games(1978)

   Unlike other computer games in which the computer
  picks a number or letter and you must guess what it is,
  in this game you think of an animal and the computer asks
  you questions and tries to guess the name of your animal.
  If the computer guesses incorrectly, it will ask you for a
  question that differentiates the animal it guessed
  from the one you were thinking of. In this way the
  computer "learns" new animals. Questions to differentiate
  new animals should be input without a question mark.
   This version of the game does not have a SAVE feature.
  If your sistem allows, you may modify the program to
  save array A$, then reload the array  when you want
  to play the game again. This way you can save what the
  computer learns over a series of games.
   At any time if you reply 'LIST' to the question "ARE YOU
  THINKING OF AN ANIMAL", the computer will tell you all the
  animals it knows so far.
   The program starts originally by knowing only FISH and BIRD.
  As you build up a file of animals you should use broad,
  general questions first and then narrow down to more specific
  ones with later animals. For example, If an elephant was to be
  your first animal, the computer would ask for a question to distinguish
  an elephant from a bird. Naturally there are hundreds of possibilities,
  however, if you plan to build a large file of animals a good question
  would be "IS IT A MAMAL".
   This program can be easily modified to deal with categories of
  things other than animals by simply modifying the initial data
  in Line 530 and the dialogue references to animal in Lines 10,
  40, 50, 130, 230, 240 and 600. In an educational environment, this
  would be a valuable program to teach the distinguishing chacteristics
  of many classes of objects -- rock formations, geography, marine life,
  cell structures, etc.
   Originally developed by Arthur Luehrmann at Dartmouth College,
  Animal was subsequently shortened and modified by Nathan Teichholtz at
  DEC and Steve North at Creative Computing

# Porting Notes
#
#   The data structure used for storing questions and
#   animals is a binary tree where each non-leaf node
#   has a question, while the leafs store the animals.
#
#   As the original program, this program doesn't store
#   old questions and animals. A good modification would
#   be to add a database to store the tree.
#    Also as the original program, this one can be easily
#   modified to not only make guesses about animals, by
#   modyfing the initial data of the tree, the questions
#   that are asked to the user and the initial message
#   function  (Lines 120 to 130, 135, 158, 160, 168, 173)
